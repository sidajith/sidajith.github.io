I am a PhD candidate at the University of Virginia studying gravitational physics. I am interested in solving problems in strong-field gravity using black holes and neutron stars. Currently, I am studying tidal interactions of pulsars and applying machine learning techniques to test gravitational theories using gravitational wave data.
